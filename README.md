## Outcomes & Screenshots
This project was developed to simulate a real-world eCommerce flow with both user and admin roles. Key user journeys include user authentication, address collection, order creation, and order trackingâ€”all managed through role-based access control.  

To enhance performance and streamline user experience, token-based authentication with JWT was implemented. User sessions and data flows are efficiently handled using browser-based memory techniques such as cookies and localStorage.

State management across the app is handled with Redux Toolkit to ensure scalable and predictable application behavior.

Below are some screenshots demonstrating the main features:
